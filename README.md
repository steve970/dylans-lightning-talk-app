Git Duet
Gem Version Build Status Code Climate Dependency
Status

Pair harmoniously! Working in a pair doesn't mean you've both lost your identity. Git Duet helps with blaming/praising by using stuff that's already in git without littering your repo history with fictitous user identities.

Installation

Install it with gem:

gem install git-duet
Usage

Setup

Make an authors file with email domain, or if you're already using git pair, just symlink your ~/.pairs file over to ~/.git-authors.

authors:
  jd: Jane Doe; jane
  fb: Frances Bar
email:
  domain: awesometown.local
git duet will use the git pair YAML structure if it has to (the difference is the top-level key being pairs instead of authors,) e.g.:

pairs:
  jd: Jane Doe; jane
  fb: Frances Bar
email:
  domain: awesometown.local
If you want your authors file to live somwhere else, just tell Git Duet about it via the GIT_DUET_AUTHORS_FILE environmental variable, e.g.:

export GIT_DUET_AUTHORS_FILE=$HOME/.secret-squirrel/git-authors
# ...
git duet jd am
Workflow stuff

Set the author and committer via git duet:

git duet jd fb
When you're ready to commit, use git duet-commit (or add an alias like a normal person. Something like dci = duet-commit should work.)

git duet-commit -v [any other git options]
# or...
git dci -v [any other git options]
When you're done pairing, set the author back to yourself with git solo:

git solo jd
Global Config Support

If you're jumping between projects and don't want to think about managing them all individually, you can operate on the global git config:

git solo -g jd
git duet --global jd fb
Email Configuration

By default, email addresses are constructed from the first initial and last name ( or optional username after a ;) plus email domain, e.g. with the following authors file:

pairs:
  jd: Jane Doe; jane
  fb: Frances Bar
email:
  domain: eternalstench.bog.local
After invoking:

git duet jd fb
Then the configured email addresses will show up like this:

git config user.email
# -> jane@eternalstench.bog.local
git config duet.env.git-author-email
# -> jane@eternalstench.bog.local
git config duet.env.git-committer-email
# -> f.bar@eternalstench.bog.local
A custom email template may be provided via the email_template config variable. The template should be a valid ERB string and the variables available are author which is the full first and last name value associated with each set of initials, initials which are the initials key, and username which is the part following ; in the author value.

pairs:
  jd: Jane Doe
  fb: Frances Bar
email_template: '<%= "#{author.gsub(/ /, "-").downcase}@hamster.local" =%>'
After invoking:

git duet jd fb
Then the configured email addresses will show up like this:

git config user.email
# -> jane-doe@hamster.local
git config duet.env.git-author-email
# -> jane-doe@hamster.local
git config duet.env.git-committer-email
# -> frances-bar@hamster.local
If there are any exceptions to either the default format or a provided email_template config var, explicitly setting email addresses by initials is supported.

pairs:
  jd: Jane Doe; jane
  fb: Frances Bar
email:
  domain: awesometown.local
email_addresses:
  jd: jane@awesome.local
Then Jane Doe's email will show up like this:

git solo jd
# ...
git config user.email
# -> jane@awesome.local
Alternatively, if you have some other preferred way to look up email addresses by initials, name or username, just use that instead:

export GIT_DUET_EMAIL_LOOKUP_COMMAND="$HOME/bin/custom-ldap-thingy"
# ... do work
git duet jd fb
# ... observe emails being set via the specified executable
The initials, name, and username will be passed as arguments to the lookup executable. Anything written to standard output will be used as the email address:

$HOME/bin/custom-ldap-thingy 'jd' 'Jane Doe' 'jane'
# -> doej@behemoth.company.local
If nothing is returned on standard output, email construction falls back to the decisions described above.

Order of Precedence

Since there are multiple ways to determine an author or committer's email, it is important to note the order of precedence used by Git Duet:

Email lookup executable configured via the GIT_DUET_EMAIL_LOOKUP_COMMAND environmental variable
Email lookup from email_addresses in your configuration file
Custom email address from ERB template defined in email_template in your configuration file
The username after the ;, followed by @ and the configured email domain
The lower-cased first letter of the author or committer's first name, followed by . followed by the lower-cased last name of the author or committer, followed by @ and the configured email domain (e.g. f.bar@baz.local)
Git hook integration

If you'd like to regularly remind yourself to set the solo or duet initials, use git duet-pre-commit in your pre-commit hook:

(in $REPO_ROOT/.git/hooks/pre-commit)

#!/bin/bash
exec git duet-pre-commit
The duet-pre-commit command will exit with a non-zero status if the cached author and committer settings are missing or stale. The default staleness cutoff is 20 minutes, but may be configured via the GIT_DUET_SECONDS_AGO_STALE environmental variable, which should be an integer of seconds, e.g.:

export GIT_DUET_SECONDS_AGO_STALE=60
# ... do work for more than a minute
git commit -v
# ... pre-commit hook fires
If you want to use the default hook (as shown above), install it while in your repo like so:

git duet-install-hook
Don't worry if you forgot you already had a pre-commit hook installed. The git duet-install-hook command will refuse to overwrite it.

RubyMine integration

In order to have the author and committer properly set when committing via RubyMine, a git wrapper executable may be used to override any executions of git commit. Such an executable is available in the Git Duet repository, and may be installed somewhere in your $PATH like so:

\curl -Ls -o ~/bin/rubymine-git-wrapper https://raw.github.com/meatballhat/git-duet/master/bin/rubymine-git-wrapper
chmod +x ~/bin/rubymine-git-wrapper
Given an install location of ~/bin/rubymine-git-wrapper as shown above, you would then update your RubyMine setting in Preferences => Version Control => Git to set Path to Git executable to the full path of ~/bin/rubymine-git-wrapper (with the ~ expanded). See issue #8 for more details.

Compatibility

Git Duet has been tested on a bunch of platform/interpreter combinations provided by Travis CI not including Rubinius.

While JRuby works it is not recommended as the VM startup time is usually longer than it takes most Git Duet commands to execute.

If you experience badness, please let us know via email or pretty please create an issue on github.
